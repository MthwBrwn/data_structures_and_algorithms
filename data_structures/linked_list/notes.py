# insertions

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- [x] append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

- [x] insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node

- [x] insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

- [x] Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- [x] Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

- [x] Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
