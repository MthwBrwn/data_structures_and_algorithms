# kth from the end of a Linked List
This lab adds to the linked list object by introducing a method for find in the value of a node a variable k distance from the end.

## Challenge
create the method and establish tests at least three for each method.

## Approach & Efficiency
As this is a traversal issue with a linked list, this is an O(n). 
The solution was chosen as it seeks to limit the traversing needed for the solution.
