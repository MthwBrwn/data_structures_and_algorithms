#  find-maximum-value
This exercise is to write a method which when called takes in an argument of a tree and returns the maximum value

## Challenge
Write a function called find-maximum-value which takes binary tree as its only input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
big O for time is O(n) as this requires full traversal of every node.
The is a space of O(n) as well as auxilliary space is required by the use of the variable maxVal .
