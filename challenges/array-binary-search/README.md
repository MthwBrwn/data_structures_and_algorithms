# Binary Search
This is the first whiteboard challenge which offers the challenge of placing a character in the middle of a given list

## Challenge
#from code challenge 03-
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency

in this challenge the Big O was not evaluated. As for the approach, my partner Raymond Ruazol and I both took turns on the white board - one would do the algorith and the other would pseudo-code. The coding was done independantly

## Solution
The solution is one that I believe will work - I initially timeboxed this for the whiteboard and coding and switched to the other lab -
There is an issue I am working out with testing
