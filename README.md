# data structures and algorithms
This is a repo of whiteboard and coded exercises

## challenges

* array_binary_search
    This is a BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key.  Return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.


* array_shift
    This is the first whiteboard challenge which offers the challenge of placing a character in the middle of a given list

* ll-merge
    Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.

##  data structures

* linked list
    * Create a Class for a LinkedList which creates an empty Linked List when instantiated. Method includes added.
    * Inserstions : The following methods were added:  append , insert-before and insert-after methods
    * # kth from the end of a Linked List . This lab adds to the linked list object by introducing a method for find in the value of a node a variable k distance from the end.

* queue
    This application sets up a class of queue and methods for that class.
    Methods include len , str, dequeue and enqueue.

* stacks
    This application sets up a methods on the Stack data structure. Methods include length, peek , pop, push. The class will accept an iterable as an argument
